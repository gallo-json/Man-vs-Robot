# Man-vs-Robot
A robot arm that plays chess against a human.

## Date
Early September 2020, 10th grade.

## Overview

The robot uses [Stockish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) chess engine as a backend to make moves. The user enters their move, and the robot arm makes its move.

The robot arm code was built on one of my previous projects: [chess-robotic-arm](https://github.com/gallo-json/chess-robotic-arm)
