# Reflection

I was never able to complete this project because I was having issues with serial communication. To try to fix this, I switched to a low level programming laguange like C which would give me more control over the hardware. I was think of having the C robot program and the Python stockfish backend comminicate over a PGN (Portable Game Notation, file format for chess games) file of the game in play. That is when I realized that I really didn't know how to program in C (as of the time I'm writing this my C skills have improved), so I ditched C.
